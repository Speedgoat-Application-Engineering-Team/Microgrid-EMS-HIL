# HIL Testing of Microgrid Energy Management System

**About**

This reference application demonstrates how to perform model-in-the-loop (MIL) and hardware-in-the-loop (HIL) simulation of a grid-connected/islanded microgrid. The model in this example comprises a medium voltage (MV) microgrid with a battery energy storage system, a photovoltaic solar park (PV), loads, as well as an energy management system (EMS) supervisory logic integrating peak shaving control. The microgrid can operate both autonomously (in islanded mode) or in synchronization with the main grid.

----------

**Learn how to:**

- Model and simulate grid-connected and islanded microgrids with renewables and utility-scale energy storage systems
- Design and test EMS supervisory logic and peak shaving controls for various operational scenarios to ensure compliance with grid codes
- Seamlessly transition from MIL to HIL within Simulink without changing your model 
- Configure a PROFINET fieldbus interface between the microgrid digital twin and the EMS controller hardware
- Leverage HIL testing to validate EMS hardware using a digital twin of the microgrid
